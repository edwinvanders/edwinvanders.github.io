# Welcome to my GitHub Pages site

I am presently located in the city of Saskatoon, situated in the province of Saskatchewan in the Canadian Prairies. 

My main professional interests are in electronic engineering and in data science.

This is where I plan to add information to supplement what is in my GitHub repositories.
